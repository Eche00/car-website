 <div class="overview">

    <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview</h1>

    <p class="text-1">Acura's flagship isn't a large sedan or even a decked-out full-size SUV; it's the 2022 NSX Type S sports car, which utilizes a hybrid powertrain. A twin-turbo V-6 and three electric motors team up for blistering acceleration but the system also enables quiet, electric-only driving so your neighbors don't have a cow every time you idle through your subdivision. Other similarly-priced sports cars such as the McLaren 570S and the Mercedes-AMG GT offer sharper handling or more raw power, but the NSX is easier to live with on a day-to-day basis. Of course, there are some downsides, including the dated cabin and infotainment system; the NSX's interior storage is also not generous.</p>

    <h1 style="margin-right: 255px; text-decoration: underline;">What's New for 2022?</h1>
    
    <p class="text-2">

        We have good news and bad news. The good news is that the 2022 NSX will wear the vaunted Type S badge and come with 600-hp version of the supercar's twin-turbo V-6 hybrid powertrain. Standard. The bad news: 2022 will be the NSX's last model year before it's discontinued, and only 300 will be available for sale in the U.S. Along with the pumped up powertrain, the 2022 model wears tweaked front-end styling and Type S badging.

        <p class="text-3">
            While it will certainly satiate your need for speed, the NSX Type S can't outpace some key rivals such as the Audi R8 or the McLaren 570S. In our testing, it snapped off lightning-quick acceleration times and managed a 2.9-second run from zero to 60 mph. Its electric-only Quiet mode, however, gives it something its rivals don't have: discretion. The V-6, the nine-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and one of the electric motors work as a team to power the rear wheels. The other two electric motors operate independently to drive the front wheels, effectively giving the NSX all-wheel drive. In Quiet and Sport modes, the steering is direct and accurate but light to the touch, which we think is an attempt to make the NSX feel maneuverable on a day-to-day basis. Such a setup, however, feels out of place on such a performance-oriented vehicle. In Sport Plus and Track modes, the electric-power-steering system dials in more weight. Regardless of the setting, the steering is crisp, and the car responds smartly to the slightest of driver inputs.

        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG</h1>
        <p class="text-4">
            Hybrid vehicles are more efficient in stop-and-go city traffic than their gasoline-only rivals, and the NSX is no different. An EPA rating of 21 mpg in the city beats the Audi R8 V-10 by a whopping 7 mpg. The Porsche 911 Carrera 4S matches the NSX's 21-mpg rating in the city and beats the NSX on the highway with a 28-mpg rating; the NSX is rated for 22 mpg highway. In our real-world highway fuel-economy test, the NSX delivered a decent 23 mpg, beating its EPA rating slightly but falling behind its nonhybrid rivals.

        <p class="text-5">
            Touted as the everyday supercar, the NSX is certainly comfortable and intuitive enough for just about anyone to use as a daily driver. But its cabin doesn't have the premium feel and luxurious amenities one expects from an Acura, let alone one that is meant to compete with the best from England and Germany. Our test car featured the optional leather-and-faux-suede seats, faux-suede headliner, and carbon-fiber-trimmed steering wheel. The bright red leather appealed to the younger among our staff, but some found it garish and juvenile. While the seats are comfortable, we'd prefer more thigh support, and enthusiastic drivers will likely desire more side bolstering as well. For something marketed as the everyday supercar, the NSX's interior storage cubbies aren't especially commodious. Its trunk is located right behind the engine, which might be problematic for hauling home your HÃ¤agen-Dazs. Plus, we managed to fit just one of our carry-on suitcases inside the tiny trunk.
